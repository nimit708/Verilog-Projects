# Verilog-Projects

These are projects which have been written in Verilog and System Verilog. 

Project 1 : Moore FSM as a sequence detector 

In this, I have used a Moore FSM which acts a sequence detector and the output is  '1' when the sequence is "1100". 
This project was simulated on ModelSim Altera Version (OS - Windows 7). This project includes 2 files: 
1.) sequence_detector.v
2.) testbench_sequence_detector.sv

In this project, i have used System Verilog to write the code in testbench_sequence_detector.sv .

Project 2 : FIFO Memory 

In this , I have written the verilog code for FIFO memory. In this I have created a 2 dimensional array for the memory which consists of 16 addresses, each having a size of 8 bits. 
This project was simulated on EDA Playground (https://www.edaplayground.com/x/4E9K). This project includes 2 files:
1.) fifo_module.v
2.) testbench_fifo_module.v
